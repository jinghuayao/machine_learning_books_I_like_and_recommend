### 1. Hang Li, Statistical Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2012.

This book cover the typical shallow models (mainly supervised models; does not cover neural networks) 
and is written in a very clear fashion. In the first chapter, the author overviews the field of machine 
learning, while in the last chapter summarizes the covered machine learning algorithms. In between, the 
author presents one main algorithm in each chapter by first laying down the theory and then giving a 
concise example. I feel this is a carefully written book after reading through it several times.

2. Zhihua Zhou, Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2016.

This book contains 16 chapters with useful appendices. It covers both supervised and unsupervised algorithms,
and also touches reinforcement learning. In terms of coverage, this book is of wide spectrum. Due to the wide coverage,
some topics are not fully expanded. This book is very popular in China. After reading through, you will find that it is
really nice to be used as an introductory book in the field of machine learning. Personally, I like the stories at the 
end of each chapter. It is safe to say that the author made great effort in adding some of his thoughts in writing the book.

3. Tieyan Liu, etal, Distributed Machine Learning: Theories, Algorithms, and Systems, China Machine Press, 2018.

This book presents distributed machine learning framework. It is very useful to the practice of training very large model with
big data set. It also contains two chapters on optimization algorithms. This book is written in a high level, in particular,
conveying the main results without proofs. If you are well trained in a techinial field such as mathematics and also have
solid background in machine learning (theory and training), there is a lot of fun in reading this book.

4. Aurélien Géron, Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to 
Build Intelligent Systems, O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (April 9, 2017).

This is a very well-written book. When I first read through this book, it was just released and was the 1st edition. 
It consists of two big parts: shallow models,neural networks. It is of wide spectrum in terms of coverage. It can help 
you get started in engineer side and also can help you gain a solid understanding of the theoretical side: the author 
includes all the main references explicitly. Geron is a machine learning expert with both genuine engineer experience
and very good machematical understanding. Personally, I had read through this book a number of times, and each time I could
gain something new. Now this book has its second edition incoporating Keras.

5. Francois Chollet, Deep Learning with Python Manning Publications, Dec 2017, 1st Edition

This is a very well-written book for gaining both engineer understanding and practice. The author is also the author of Keras,
a very friendly-to-use API for implementing deep neural networks. The representation is concise, sufficiently detailed, and full
of ideas and sound personal understanding about deep learning models. I especially like the comments of the authors about the role of
gates in LSTM cell in reality. This is a book which deserves your reading through a number of times as I confirmed after doing so.
