# machine_learning_books_I_recommend

There are many very good books for machine learning and artificial intellgence in general. These books have different
emphases and styles, some may pay more attention on mathematical or statistical side, some on engineering or applied side, 
some on supervised algorithms, some on unsupervised algorithms, some on deep learning, and others on reinforcement learning. 
As the field is developing fast, it is crucial to form your own knowledge structure and system on the subject and related fields. 
In my experience, it is crucial to start any field with very good textbooks and classic papers. The choice of books embodies taste. Among the statistical machine learning texts I read (with some of which read through several times), some align to my taste, and I list them
here for reference.
