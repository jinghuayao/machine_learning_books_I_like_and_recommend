1. Hang Li, Statistical Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2012.

This book cover the typical shallow models and is written in a very clear fashin. 
In the first chapter, the author overviews the field of machine learning, while in the last
chapter summarizes the covered machine learning algorithms. In between, the author presents one
main algorithm in each chapter by first laying down the theory and then giving an concise example.
I feel this is a carefully written book after reading through it several times.
