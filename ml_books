1. Hang Li, Statistical Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2012.

This book cover the typical shallow models (mainly supervised models; does not cover neural networks) 
and is written in a very clear fashion. In the first chapter, the author overviews the field of machine 
learning, while in the last chapter summarizes the covered machine learning algorithms. In between, the 
author presents one main algorithm in each chapter by first laying down the theory and then giving an 
concise example. I feel this is a carefully written book after reading through it several times.

2. Zhihua Zhou, Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2016.

This book contains 16 chapters with useful appendices. It covers both supervised and unsupervised algorithms,
and also touches reinforcement learning. In terms of coverage, this book is of wide spectrum. Due to the wide coverage,
some topics are not fully expanded. This book is very popular in China. After reading through, you will find that it is
really nice to be used as an introductory book in the field of machine learning. Personally, I like the stories at the 
end of each chapter. It is safe to say that the author made great effort in adding some of his thoughts in writing the book.

3. Tieyan Liu, etal, Distributed Machine Learning: Theories, Algorithms, and Systems, China Machine Press, 2018.

This book presents distributed machine learning framework. It is very useful to the practice of training very large model with
big data set. It also contains two chapters on optimization algorithms. This book is written in a high level, in particular,
conveying the main results without proofs. If you are well trained in a techinial field such as mathematics and also have
solid background in machine learning (theory and training), there is a lot of fun in reading this book.
