1. Hang Li, Statistical Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2012.

This book cover the typical shallow models (mainly supervised models; does not cover neural networks) 
and is written in a very clear fashion. In the first chapter, the author overviews the field of machine 
learning, while in the last chapter summarizes the covered machine learning algorithms. In between, the 
author presents one main algorithm in each chapter by first laying down the theory and then giving an 
concise example. I feel this is a carefully written book after reading through it several times.

2. Zhihua Zhou, Machine Learning, Tsinghua University Press, 2016.

This book contains 16 chapters with useful appendices. It covers both supervised and unsupervised algorithms,
and also touches reinforcement learning. In terms of coverage, this book is wide-spectrum. Due to the wide coverage,
some topics are not fully expaned. This book is very popular in China. After reading through, you will find that it is
really nice to be used as an introductory book on the field. Personally, I like the stories at the end of each chapter.
It is safe to say that the author made an effort in adding some of his thoughts in writing the book.
